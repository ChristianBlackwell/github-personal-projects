# Personal Projects - Project Details

Bottle_Flip.py

This is a personal project I developed independently. Inspired by my son (6) and his friends' enthusiasm for bottle flipping, I created a mini "game" that provided entertainment for him. The initial completion of the project brought him so much joy that he actively requests to play it. While the project is relatively simple, I take pride in its success and the enjoyment it has brought.


Random_Password_Generator.py & Snake_Game.py

These projects were undertaken by following a written tutorial, without the aid of a video guide. Throughout the process, I encountered and resolved various errors and bugs, mostly through independent problem-solving. Although I did not create these projects entirely from scratch, I possess a comprehensive understanding of their inner workings and can modify and update the code as needed. Snake_Game.py, being more advanced, presented a challenge considering my limited experience of only a few months in coding. 


PDF Resume Generator.py

During my exploration of new project ideas, I discovered the realm of PDF editing and found it intriguing. Recognizing the significance of a well-crafted resume, I decided to leverage Python to create a program that generates professional resumes in PDF format. Although I drew inspiration from previous projects such as the Random Password Generator and Snake Game, I pursued this endeavor without relying on any specific guide, relying instead on a process of trial and error combined with extensive online research. The undertaking proved to be both challenging and exhilarating, ultimately yielding a refined resume generation tool. With an emphasis on producing proficient yet elegantly simple resumes, this tool has proven to be a valuable source of learning experiences of immeasurable worth. Reflecting upon my journey, I take pride in the knowledge gained and eagerly anticipate the future growth that awaits as I continually hone my skills.

I am open to answering any inquiries or welcoming any advice pertaining to these projects.
