Bottle_Flip.py
  This is a project I created on my own. My son (6) and his friends are very into flipping bottles. I used that to create a mini "game" for him. He enjoyed it so much, he took over my computer for about 30 minutes when I     first completed this and reguarly asks to play. It's a simple project but because of this I am rather proud of it.
