Bottle_Flip.py

This is a project I created on my own. My son (6) and his friends are very into flipping bottles. I used that to create a mini "game" for him. He enjoyed it so much, he took over my computer for about 30 minutes when I     first completed this and reguarly asks to play. It's a simple project but because of this I am rather proud of it.


Random_Password_Generator.py & Snake_Game.py

These are projects I created follow a written tutorial (no follow along video). Of course, along the way there were errors and bugs that popped up, which I had to fix on my own (mostly). Although, I did not create these from scratch on my own, I do understand what is being done within these programs and change/edit the code to update or make changes. Snake_Game.py is a bit advanced for me at this point (having only been coding for a few months) but it was a fun project, where I learned a lot and I look forward to coming back to something similiar in the future to see how I hold up.

I'd be happy to answer any questions about any of these projects or take any advice, of course!
